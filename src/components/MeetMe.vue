        <p> My name is Olivia Sackitey. I was born and raised in Queens, New York, and have always had a strong interest in STEM-related subjects and music. Currently, I am a rising sophomore at Northwestern University and I'm majoring in Computer Science.</p>
        <p> Growing up, getting ready for school was always an exciting time because my dad would play a mix of jazz, hip-hop, and R&B music every morning on his radio. Through this, I would learn the hottest new songs while also still getting a summary of current events. My dad would eventually teach me about some of the hip-hop legends, classic R&B singers and songwriters, and would later name my sister after the late jazz singer Lena Horne. </p>
        <p> By second grade, I was begging my dad for my own radio. He eventually succumbed to my pleading and bought me my first radio. Every morning as I opened my eyes, I was also reaching to find the remote to turn on my radio. I even began to purposely slow down when getting dressed so I could sneak in a couple of extra songs; this became a habit of mine that is still part of my daily routine! </p>
        <p> A few years would go by, and my first radio would be upgraded to the Bose Wave Radio. It had much better sound quality than what I was used to; 2020 marks eight years since I first received it. Since my radio lacks portability,  I've become an avid Spotify user in recent years. I have gotten into listening to the artist's full albums and exploring new genres.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get to know me a little more or see what I'm listening to, you can connect with me on LinkedIn, email me, or take a look at my Spotify. </p>
